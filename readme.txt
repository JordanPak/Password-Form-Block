Display the current post/page password form.

== Description ==

The Password Form block allows the editor to place blocks _before_ the password
form is displayed instead of removing all content before the password is
validated.

== Installation ==

1. Extract `password-form-block.zip` archive content to the `wp-content/plugins/password-form-block` directory.
1. Activate **Password Form Block** plugin in your admin.
1. Set a password for the page/post/etc in your editor.
1. Add the Password Form block in the content where you'd like the password form to display. Content after the form won't display until the password is validated.
